## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-25

First public release.

- MCP server for App Store Connect over stdio or Streamable HTTP. 68 tools in 14 toolsets, 7 of them on by default.
- Read-only until you enable writes. Anything public, permanent or costing money shows a preview first and then waits for a human yes.
- Releases with a preflight check, TestFlight, metadata in fastlane or Expo format, screenshots, reviews, decoded sales and finance reports, IAPs, signing, Xcode Cloud and IPA/PKG uploads.
- For whatever the workflow tools don't cover: raw API access checked against Apple's pinned OpenAPI spec.
- Team and individual API keys, profiles, keychain storage, and per-project `.hamn.toml` pins that can only narrow permissions.
- Ships via Homebrew, signed release binaries, Docker, a Claude Desktop `.mcpb` and the MCP Registry, plus agent skills you install with `hamn skills install`.
